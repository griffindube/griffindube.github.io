      <description>I think that I shall never see A poem lovely as a tree.&#xA;A tree whose hungry mouth is prest Against the earth&amp;rsquo;s sweet flowing breast;&#xA;A tree that looks at God all day, And lifts her leafy arms to pray;&#xA;A tree that may in Summer wear A nest of robins in her hair;&#xA;Upon whose bosom snow has lain; Who intimately lives with rain.&#xA;Poems are made by fools like me, But only God can make a tree.</description>
